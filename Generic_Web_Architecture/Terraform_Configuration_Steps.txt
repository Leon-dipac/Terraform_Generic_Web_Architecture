Let's have a little walk through the infrastructure needed for this web application :

--> The initial architecture of this web app will consist of a number of AWS Resources such as : 
1- EC2 instances
2- Amazon S3 Bucket
3- A Virtual Private Cloud " VPC " and some Subnets
4- Security Groups having defined inbound and outbound Rules
5- An Application Load Balancer which will have an Application Load Balancer target group attached to it.
6- A Route 53 Zone with DNS Record
7- A RDS instances

NB: We will also define the AWS BackEnd Configuration using the Terraform Configuration File.
